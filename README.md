# Toggle Toggle
A simple Minecraft mod for clients adding two keybindings for switching sneaking or sprinting methods between hold and toggle.

Since Minecraft's version 1.15, player can choose to toggle sprint and/or sneak instead of holding the key.  
This mod adds a way to quickly change those two options without going to the settings screen.

## Dependencies
**Both [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) and [Fabric API](https://modrinth.org/mod/fabric-api) are required** for this mod to work.  
**[Cloth Config API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config) is also needed** - it's used for a simple configuration and configuration screen.  
Toggle Toggle is compatible with [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) (optional, adds config screen access).

## Default keys
| Function | Key |
|--:|:-:|
| Change Sneak Mode | B |
| Change Sprint Mode | V |

These keybindings can be changed freely in the Controls (`Game Menu` -> `Settings` -> `Controls`) menu.
