# Toggle Toggle
A simple Minecraft mod for clients adding two keybindings for switching sneaking or sprinting methods between hold and toggle.

Since Minecraft's version 1.15, player can choose to toggle sprint and/or sneak instead of holding the key.  
This mod adds a way to quickly change those two options without going to the settings screen.

## Dependencies
**Both [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) and [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) are required for this mod to work.**

## Default keys
| Function | Key |
|--:|:-:|
| Change Sneak Mode | V |
| Change Sprint Mode | B |

These keybindings can be changed freely in the Controls (`Game Menu` -> `Settings` -> `Controls`) menu.
